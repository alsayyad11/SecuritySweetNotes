## What Is Credential Stuffing?
**Credential Stuffing** is an automated attack where an adversary uses previously breached username/password pairs (also known as "credentials") to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on different systems.

### Why It Works
- Most users **reuse passwords** across multiple sites.
- Billions of credentials are already **leaked in public breaches** (available on the dark web or via data dump sites).
- Attackers use **automation tools and bots** to test credentials quickly across large login surfaces.

---

## Attack Lifecycle

### 1. **Credential Collection**
Sources:
- Dark web markets
- Public breach sites (e.g., `raidforums`, `exploit.in`)
- Dumps from previous breaches (e.g., `Collection #1`, `RockYou2021`)

Example combo list:
```

[user1@example.com](mailto:user1@example.com):password123
[admin@test.com](mailto:admin@test.com):12345678
[ahmed@domain.com](mailto:ahmed@domain.com):qwerty2020

````

### 2. **Automation & Execution**
Tools:
- üß∞ BlackBullet, Snipr, OpenBullet
- üêç Python scripts using `requests`, `aiohttp`, `mechanize`
- ü§ñ Selenium headless automation

Targets:
- Web login portals
- Mobile APIs (less protected)
- GraphQL or RESTful endpoints
- Third-party integrations (e.g., SSO)

### 3. **Result Filtering**
Successful hits (valid credentials) are:
- Logged by the tool
- Stored in "Hits.txt" or "Valid.txt"
- Often enriched (e.g., via OSINT tools)

---

## Post-Exploitation

Once valid credentials are obtained:
-  Full access to user accounts
-  Steal financial information or perform fraudulent purchases
-  Exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g., addresses, SSNs, PII)
-  Identity impersonation
-  Lateral movement within organization (if corporate credentials)
-  Sell access on dark web marketplaces

##  Credential Stuffing vs Brute Force

| Feature             | Credential Stuffing                      | Brute Force                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Basis               | Real leaked credentials                  | Randomly guessed credentials       |
| Efficiency          | High (if credentials are reused)         | Low (unless password is weak)      |
| Detection Evasion   | Harder to detect if throttling is weak   | Easier to detect (mass attempts)   |
| Tooling             | Specialized (e.g., OpenBullet configs)   | General (e.g., Hydra, Medusa)      |

##  Mitigation Techniques & Defensive Strategies

###  1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
Even if the password is valid, attackers can‚Äôt bypass the second factor.

**Best Practices:**
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- WebAuthn (hardware keys)
- SMS OTP (less secure, but still helpful)

---

### 2. **Strong Password Policies**
- Enforce **unique, complex passwords**
- Use **passphrases** or require length ‚â• 12 chars
- Prevent known breached passwords (e.g., via HIBP password list)

---

### 3. **Password Hashing & Salting**
Store passwords using:
- `bcrypt`, `Argon2`, or `PBKDF2`
- Add unique **salt** per user to prevent rainbow table attacks

---

### 4. **Bot Detection & CAPTCHA**
- Implement **reCAPTCHA v3** (behavior-based)
- Apply CAPTCHA after a few failed attempts
- Block **headless browser** user agents

---

### 5. **Device Fingerprinting**
Track users via:
- User agent
- Screen resolution
- OS/platform
- Geolocation/IP
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., mouse movement)

Raise flags if multiple failed logins from the same fingerprint.

---

### 6. **Rate Limiting & Account Lockouts**
- Set login limits per IP, username, or device
- Lock account after N failed attempts
- Apply exponential backoff delays

---

### 7. **IP Reputation & GeoIP Rules**
- Block access from known bad IP ranges (TOR, proxies)
- Block access from high-risk countries (if applicable)
- Use services like Project Honeypot, AbuseIPDB, MaxMind

---

### 8. **Credential Leak Monitoring**
- Use **HaveIBeenPwned API** or similar services
- Alert users if their email appears in public breaches
- Force password resets if reused credentials are found

---

### 9. **Session Management Hardening**
- Invalidate old sessions after password reset
- Rotate session tokens frequently
- Enforce IP/session binding (optional)

## üë®‚Äçüíª Sample Node.js Login with Basic Protection

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

async function login(req, res) {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  const user = await db.findUserByEmail(email);
  if (!user) return res.status(401).send("Invalid credentials");

  const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashedPassword);
  if (!match) return res.status(401).send("Invalid credentials");

  const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: "1h" });
  res.cookie("session", token, { httpOnly: true, secure: true });
  res.redirect("/dashboard");
}

app.post('/login',
  rateLimit({ windowMs: 60 * 1000, max: 5 }), // 5 requests per minute
  login
);
````

##  Sample Credential Stuffing Attack (for Testing Purposes)

```bash
python3 stuffing.py --combo creds.txt --url https://target.com/login --threads 20
```

Sample `stuffing.py` (simplified):

```python
import requests

def login(email, password):
    r = requests.post("https://target.com/login", data={
        "email": email,
        "password": password
    })
    return "dashboard" in r.text

with open("creds.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        email, password = line.strip().split(":")
        if login(email, password):
            print(f"[+] Valid: {email}:{password}")
```
