# `robots.txt`

 is a plain text file placed in the **root directory** of a website to instruct **web crawlers** (like Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.) on which paths they are allowed or disallowed from crawling.

### Default path:
```

[https://example.com/robots.txt](https://example.com/robots.txt)

````

## 🛠 File Structure

A `robots.txt` file consists of one or more sets of directives targeted at specific or all crawlers.

| Directive     | Description                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `User-agent`  | The name of the bot (e.g., `Googlebot`, or `*` for all)  |
| `Disallow`    | Paths that should not be crawled                         |
| `Allow`       | Exceptions to `Disallow` (used mainly by Googlebot)      |
| `Sitemap`     | Points to the site's XML sitemap                         |

### 🧾 Example:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Allow: /admin/login.html
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
````

## 🔍 SEO Usage

* ✅ Prevents indexing of low-value pages (e.g., `/cart`, `/checkout`)
* ✅ Helps avoid duplicate content
* ✅ Optimizes crawl budget for large websites

⚠️ Misconfigurations can block important content or expose sensitive URLs!

## 🔐 Security Risks

Although `robots.txt` is **not a security mechanism**, developers often mistakenly list **sensitive directories**, like:

```txt
Disallow: /backup/
Disallow: /secret/
Disallow: /admin-panel/
```

Attackers can easily read the file and manually visit these hidden paths!

---

## 🧪 Usage in Penetration Testing

### ✅ Practical Steps:

1. Access:

   ```
   https://target.com/robots.txt
   ```

2. Look for `Disallow` entries.

3. Try accessing those directories manually:

   ```
   https://target.com/admin-panel/
   https://target.com/backup/
   ```

4. If any page or file loads (admin login, ZIP files, databases), dig deeper.

## 👑 Finding Admin Panels via `robots.txt`

### 💡 How?

Some developers hide admin dashboards and accidentally list them in `robots.txt`.

### 🧾 Example:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /secret-login/
```

### 🕵️ As a Pentester:

1. Visit:

   ```
   https://target.com/robots.txt
   ```

2. Find entries like:

   ```
   Disallow: /admin/
   ```

3. Try:

   ```
   https://target.com/admin/
   ```

4. If it loads a login page, attempt brute-force or look for bypasses.

## 🔧 Tools You Can Use

| Tool              | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `curl`            | Fetch the file: `curl https://site.com/robots.txt` |
| `dirb`/`gobuster` | Use discovered paths as a wordlist for fuzzing     |
| `Burp Suite`      | Monitor and analyze requests to hidden endpoints   |

## 🔥 Real-World Example (PoC)

### 📁 `robots.txt` Content:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /backup/
Disallow: /hidden-login/
```

### 💣 Exploitation:

* Visited: `https://victim.com/admin/` → Admin dashboard appeared
* Visited: `https://victim.com/backup/` → Found `db.sql` backup
* Visited: `https://victim.com/hidden-login/` → Secret login page not linked elsewhere

---

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations

* Do **not** rely on `robots.txt` for security.
* Use proper **authentication and authorization**.
* Avoid placing sensitive files or folders in public-accessible paths.
* Monitor access attempts to restricted paths.

---

## ✅ Summary

* `robots.txt` is made for **search engine guidance**, **not security**.
* Attackers often use it to discover **hidden admin panels**, **backups**, or **unlisted pages**.
* It should be among the **first recon targets** during any assessment.
* Protect sensitive areas with **real security**, not just obscurity.
